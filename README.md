## Project 1

For a grayscale input image, write a code that; 
1. flips the image vertically 
2. flips the image horizontally 
3. rotates the image 90 deg counterclockwise 
4. rotates the image 90 deg clockwise 
5. resizes the image to the half by keeping the aspect ratio 
6. applies negative transformation on the image 
7. applies gamma transformation on the image 
8. computes the histogram of the image

## Project 2

1) Develop a program performing histogram equalization on the input (grayscale) image: 

  a. First, write your own algorithm for histogram equalization. 

  b. Then, use built-in histogram equalization function. 

  c. Finally, display outputs of both your and built-in function. 

2) Develop a program applying NxN averaging filter to the input (grayscale) image: 

  a. First, write your own algorithm for filtering. Size of the output image should be equal to size of the input image.

  b. Then, use built-in filtering function for filtering. 

  c. Finally, display outputs of both your and built-in function.
